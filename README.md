# Keylogger_using_Python
"This program uses the 'keyboard' module to detect key presses and log them along with their corresponding time stamps to a log file. It is written in Python, and will keep running until it is manually stopped."

# Explanation of the Code :
This program uses the keyboard library to detect key presses and log them in a text file. It defines a callback for when a key is pressed, which is called on_key_press. The callback function writes the name of the key and the current time to a text file called log.txt, whenever a key is pressed. <br />
Lastly, the program uses a while loop to keep the program running and listening for key presses.

# Compatibility :
1- Python 3.9 <br />
2- Run it as an administrator
